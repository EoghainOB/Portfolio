      "For this project I created a simple application that allowed my young daughter to be able to practice maths. The user can select the type of sum they want to try, addition, subtraction, division or multiplication, as well as the level of difficulty from easy, medium and hard. When they click the start button they are presented with a sum. The user enters the answer into the field and clicks the 'Submit Answer' button. If it is correct the outline will light up green and display the next sum, if it is incorrect it will light up red and the sum will remain.",

The user can search well known painters and their work in the input field with suggestions taken from a list of popular artists and their artwork. This queries the API and returns the results on a results page, showing the work along with the title of the piece and a link to the page of that piece of art on the Rijksmuseum website.",

The site is made with Typescript on the front and backend and uses Express to interact with the MongoDB, which contains the products. The site integrates pagination as well as filtering and search and each product has its own page with dedicated URL. The user can select the quantity of milk using the slider and it can be added to the cart. The cart is very basic and is my first time creating one and it features the ability to update the cart by deleting the items.",
